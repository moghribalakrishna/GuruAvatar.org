"Create a digital illustration for an educational technology website homepage. The image should depict a futuristic classroom setting with the following elements:

A central, glowing holographic avatar resembling a wise guru or teacher, floating above a modern desk.
Around the avatar, display various holographic icons representing different subjects: a DNA strand for biology, mathematical equations, a globe for geography, and circuit diagrams for computer science.
Students of diverse ethnicities and ages, some seated and some standing, interacting with floating, transparent touchscreens or holographic displays.
Subtle, ethereal lines connecting the students' heads to the central avatar, representing AI-powered personalized learning.
In the background, have a large window showing a serene natural scene with trees and a calm lake, symbolizing mindfulness and balance.
Incorporate soft, glowing blue and orange lights throughout the scene, matching GuruAvatar's color scheme.
Above the scene, in elegant, futuristic typography, display the text 'GuruAvatar: Revolutionizing Education'.

The overall style should be clean, modern, and slightly abstract, with a color palette dominated by blues, whites, and touches of orange. The atmosphere should feel inspiring, innovative, and calming."
